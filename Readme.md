# AI-Bot
 
You can connect a Slack bot to this project and feed the datastore with the
information you need the model to train on.

This can help other teams directly get the info from the bot rather than
disturbing a real human.

# Setup

- AWS keys injected as environment variables
- Slack workspace keys
